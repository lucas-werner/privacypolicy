Introduction
Privacy and Data Protection Program
[CUSTOMER NAME] and other affiliates as created or acquired from time to time (collectively “[CUSTOMER NAME]”) is subject to privacy and data protection regulations worldwide and the organization is committed to complying with applicable portions of those regulations (the “Privacy and Data Protection Regulations”).  This program document outlines [CUSTOMER NAME]’ key responsibilities to comply with Privacy and Data Protection Regulations as they apply to the processing of Personal Data.
[CUSTOMER NAME] is established in the European Union through its subsidiary, [CUSTOMER NAME] and complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) via its third party Data Protection Officer in The Netherlands.  [CUSTOMER NAME] also maintains a third party Data Protection Representative in the United Kingdom pursuant to UK GDPR.  All other global privacy and data protection compliance is managed through [CUSTOMER NAME]’ Operations team.  [CUSTOMER NAME] aims to comply with privacy and data protection standards that provide for the most protection of Data Subjects’ rights.
Compliance with the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations is described by this program document and addressed in related policies and procedures set forth in Exhibit A. The Privacy and Data Protection Regulations and this policy apply to all of [CUSTOMER NAME]’ Personal Data processing functions, including those performed on customers’, clients’, employees’, suppliers’ and partners’ Personal Data, and any other Personal Data that [CUSTOMER NAME] Processes from any source.  [CUSTOMER NAME] has implemented engineering and communications procedures/worksheets that require a review of Privacy by Design principles prior to implementation or development of processes that involve personal data.
This program applies to all [CUSTOMER NAME] employees and outsourced personnel. Any breach of the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations will be dealt with under [CUSTOMER NAME] disciplinary policy and may also be a criminal offence, in which case the matter will be reported as soon as possible to the appropriate authorities. Partners and any third parties working with or for [CUSTOMER NAME], and who have or may have access to Personal Data, are expected to comply with all contractual and applicable regulatory obligations. No Third Party may access Personal Data held by [CUSTOMER NAME] without having first agreed to confidentiality language set forth in the applicable agreement, which imposes on the third-party obligations no less onerous than those to which [CUSTOMER NAME] is committed, and which gives [CUSTOMER NAME] the right to audit compliance with the agreement.
[CUSTOMER NAME] engages with consultants to assist with periodic audits of the program.  In addition, it utilizes consultants and industry resources to prepare for changes to Privacy and Data Protection Regulations.
Definitions
Definitions vary by Privacy and Data Protection Regulation.  The most common definitions are included below:
Controller - determines the purpose and means of processing.  A Controller may be referred to as a business owner, business operator or other designation depending on the applicable Privacy and Data Protection Regulation.
Data Subject – any living individual who is the subject of Personal Data Processed by or on behalf of [CUSTOMER NAME].  
Personal Data – any information that is linked or reasonably linked to an identified or identifiable Data Subject; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.  California considers the above information as it relates to a “household” to also be Personal Data.
Processing/Process/Processed/Processes – any operation or set of operations which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. 
Processor – conducts the processing of Personal Data on behalf, or at the direction, of the Controller.  A Processor may be referred to as a service provider, contractor or other designation depending on the applicable Privacy and Data Protection Regulation.
Third Party – a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the Data Subject, Controller, Processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the Controller or Processor, are authorized to Process Personal Data.  
Responsibilities and roles under the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations
[CUSTOMER NAME] manages Privacy and Data Protection Regulation compliance through its Operations team. [CUSTOMER NAME] has assigned the role of EU Data Protection Officer to DPO Consultancy located in the Netherlands and UK Data Protection Representative to DPO Consultancy located in the UK.  Under EU GDPR and UK GDPR, there are no employees of [CUSTOMER NAME] with the required “independence” to act as Data Protection Officer under those regulations.  Operations assists the EU Data Protection Officer and UK Data Protection Representative in fulfilling their responsibilities set forth under the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations.
Operations is responsible for overall management of the Privacy and Data Protection Program and maintains this program document as well as conducts periodic meetings with Senior Management regarding the program, including results of any audits, notification of issues, and notification of new Privacy and Data Protection Regulations or changes to existing Privacy and Data Protection Regulations.  As needed, Operations partners with third parties, such as the EU Data Protection Officer and/or UK Data Protection Representative, to communicate with team members and third parties.
Operations is responsible for maintaining the register of processing (Data Processing Map) in the light of any changes to [CUSTOMER NAME]’ activities (as determined by changes to data processing and management review) and to any additional requirements identified by means of Data Processing Impact Assessments (DPIAs). Relevant Operations personnel and the EU Data Protection Officer review the Data Processing Map when any changes are made and advise on potential risks.  The Data Processing Map and any DPIAs are made available to government authorities pursuant to proper request.
Operations maintains all privacy and data protection documentation, including internal and user-facing policies, which are updated as needed.  Operations conducts research and tracking of legislation and manages team member training.
All employees are accountable for the management of Personal Data within [CUSTOMER NAME] and for ensuring that compliance with data protection legislation and good practice can be demonstrated. Employees competence requirements are set forth in the Privacy and Data Protection Competence Requirements.  Employee job descriptions include requirements set forth in the Personal Data Protection Job Description Responsibilities document.  This accountability includes:
implementation of the Privacy and Data Protection Regulation program; and 
security and risk management in relation to compliance with the program via adherence to [CUSTOMER NAME]’ Information Security Policy.
Compliance with data protection legislation is the responsibility of all [CUSTOMER NAME] employees  who Process Personal Data and/or work with third parties that Process Personal Data on [CUSTOMER NAME]’ behalf. 
[CUSTOMER NAME] employees are responsible for ensuring that any Personal Data about them and supplied by them to [CUSTOMER NAME] is accurate and up-to-date.  Employees seeking clarification on any aspect of data protection compliance related to their own Personal Data or that of third parties can contact: EU - eudpo@[CUSTOMER NAME].com, UK - ukdpr@[CUSTOMER NAME].com, Other - dpo@[CUSTOMER NAME].com.  
Employees are trained on privacy and data protection requirements in relation to their specific roles. All training is managed by Operations and provided via third party training platform or ad hoc training by the Operations team, the EU DPO, or the UK DPR, as applicable.  The training schedule is set forth in the Privacy and Data Protection Training Matrix (see Tab 2).
Any Processor processing Personal Data with or on behalf of [CUSTOMER NAME] is required pursuant to the terms of specific contracts to comply with Privacy and Data Protection Regulation requirements to the same standard and level as [CUSTOMER NAME] itself.
[CUSTOMER NAME] does not provide online service to anyone under the age of majority (which ranges from 13-20 years old depending on jurisdiction and other age ranges elsewhere).  Users must have reached the minimum age of consent in their jurisdiction prior to using our service per the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. 
Data protection principles
All processing of Personal Data must be conducted in accordance with the data protection principles as set out in Privacy and Data Protection Regulations.  For purposes of uniformity in the program, the b[... ELLIPSIZATION ...]cedures set forth in the Information Security Policy will apply in all cases.
Personal Data must be disposed of securely in accordance with the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations and in accordance with the Information Security Policy.
Data transfers
[CUSTOMER NAME] treats all exports of data from within the Data Subject’s home country to other countries (or regions, i.e., with respect to EU GDPR) as unlawful unless there is an appropriate “level of protection for the fundamental rights of the Data Subjects.”  In all cases, [CUSTOMER NAME] will enter into appropriate contractual terms regarding the transfer (Data Processing Agreement), covering a Processor’s obligations as well as any of its sub-processors.  Third parties are assessed at the beginning of the relationship, upon any changes to the relationship, and every one to three years during the relationship pursuant to [CUSTOMER NAME]’ Vendor Management Policy and Procedures.  The following additional safeguards or exceptions may also apply depending on the origin and destination of the Personal Data:
An adequacy decision
Many countries maintain lists of other countries that adhere to adequate information and security protocols.  For example, countries that are members of the European Economic Area (EEA) but not of the EU are accepted as having met the conditions for an adequacy decision related to Personal Data derived from those countries’ residents.  
Binding corporate rules
Parties may adopt approved binding corporate rules for the transfer of data outside a Data Subject’s home country. In the EU, this requires submission to the relevant supervisory authority for approval of the rules that [CUSTOMER NAME] is seeking to rely upon.  
Model contract clauses
[CUSTOMER NAME] have adopted approved model contract clauses for the transfer of data outside of the EEA in connection with their Joint Controller arrangement.  These clauses may be provided in conjunction with a Data Processing Agreement and are updated as required by changes in law, regulation, or guidance.
Exceptions
In the absence of an adequacy decision, binding corporate rules, and/or model contract clauses, a transfer of Personal Data to a third country or international organization shall only take place on one of the following conditions:
the Data Subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for the Data Subject due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards;
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the Data Subject and the Controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the Data Subject's request;
the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the Data Subject between the Controller and another natural or legal person;
the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest;
the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and/or
the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of other persons, where the Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.
In all cases, a Transfer Impact Assessment will be completed (see below).
Assessments
Data Protection Impact Assessments
[CUSTOMER NAME] conducts data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) in relation to the processing of Personal Data by [CUSTOMER NAME] that potentially poses a high risk to the rights and freedoms to Data Subjects. [CUSTOMER NAME] DPIA template follows EU requirements and guidelines.  [CUSTOMER NAME] uses a template provided by its EU Data Protection Officer.  Where, as a result of a DPIA, [CUSTOMER NAME] chooses to commence processing of Personal Data that could cause damage and/or distress to the Data Subjects, the decision as to whether [CUSTOMER NAME] may proceed must be escalated for review to the Chief Operating Officer and the EU Data Protection Officer/UK Data Protection Representative.  The EU Data Protection Officer/UK Data Protection Representative shall, if there are significant concerns either as to the potential damage or distress or the quantity of data concerned, escalate the matter to the applicable supervisory authority.
DPIA are updated at least every three (3) years and more often if there is a material change in the processing activity.
Appropriate controls will be selected from Annex A of ISO 27001 or similar security standards and applied to reduce the level of risk associated with processing individual data to an acceptable level, by reference to the requirements of the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations.  Mitigating measures are communicated by Operations to the business owner of the processing activity, who is responsible for implementation of any necessary changes to the process.  The applicable DPIA is updated once the additional controls are in place.
DPIAs are maintained by Operations in both the Shared Drive and saved to the appropriate Processing Activity record in [NAME SYSTEM].
Privacy Impact Assessment 
[CUSTOMER NAME] conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) as required by various Privacy and Data Protection Regulations related to the processing of personal data.  PIAs are conducted on all new processing activities that do not warrant a DPIA. Where a DPIA is conducted for a processing activity, a PIA will not be conducted.  PIAs are conducted and maintained by Operations within [NAME SYSTEM] using the [NAME SYSTEM] template and saved to the appropriate Processing Activity record in [NAME SYSTEM].
Transfer Impact Assessments
[CUSTOMER NAME] conducts Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) as set forth by the EU for transfers of data across borders (unless approved within certain regions, i.e., EEA).  TIAs are not completed for transfers of European Personal Data to jurisdictions that have obtained Adequacy status (however, appropriate contractual measures are still required).  [CUSTOMER NAME] utilizes a TIA template provided by its EU Data Protection Officer, who reviews and provides advice in each instance.  Where possible, risks are mitigated contractually and by implementing supplementary measures according to the requirements of the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations and the Supervisory Authorities' guidelines.  Unmitigated risks are provided to the Chief Operating Officer for review and acceptance or denial and completed TIAs are maintained by Operations in both the Shared Drive and saved to the appropriate Asset record in [NAME SYSTEM].
LIA
[CUSTOMER NAME] conducts Legitimate Interest Assessments (LIAs) as required by various Privacy and Data Protection Regulations related to the processing of personal data that relies on the legitimate interest legal processing basis.  LIAs related to European Personal Data are reviewed by [CUSTOMER NAME]’ EU Data Protection Officer. Unmitigated risks are provided to the Chief Operating Officer for review and acceptance or denial. LIAs are conducted and maintained by Operations within [NAME SYSTEM] using the [NAME SYSTEM] template and saved to the appropriate Processing Activity record in [NAME SYSTEM].
Information asset register/data inventory
[CUSTOMER NAME] has established a data inventory and data flow process as part of its approach to address risks and opportunities throughout its privacy and data protection compliance program. [CUSTOMER NAME]’ data inventory determines:
business processes that use Personal Data;
source of Personal Data; 
volume of Data Subjects;
description of each item of Personal Data;
processing activity;
maintains the inventory of data categories of Personal Data it Processes; 
documents the purpose(s) for which each category of Personal Data is used;
recipients, and potential recipients, of the Personal Data;
the role of [CUSTOMER NAME] throughout the data flow;
key systems and repositories;
any data transfers; and
all retention and disposal requirements. 
[CUSTOMER NAME] reviews and updates the data inventory on an ongoing basis to ensure it remains accurate related to any changes in the entities processing activities.
