1. Introduction

1.1 Privacy and Data Protection Program
[CUSTOMER_NAME] and other affiliates as created or acquired from time to time (collectively “[CUSTOMER_NAME]”) is subject to privacy and data protection regulations worldwide and the organization is committed to complying with applicable portions of those regulations (the “Privacy and Data Protection Regulations”).   This program document outlines [CUSTOMER_NAME]’ key responsibilities to comply with Privacy and Data Protection Regulations as they apply to the processing of Personal Data.

[CUSTOMER_NAME] is established in the European Union through its subsidiary, [CUSTOMER_NAME] and complies with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) via its third party Data Protection Officer in The Netherlands.  [CUSTOMER_NAME] also maintains a third party Data Protection Representative in the United Kingdom pursuant to UK GDPR.  All other global privacy and data protection compliance is managed through [CUSTOMER_NAME]’ Operations team.  [CUSTOMER_NAME] aims to comply with privacy and data protection standards that provide for the most protection of Data Subjects’ rights.

Compliance with the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations is described by this program document and addressed in related policies and procedures set forth in Exhibit A. The Privacy and Data Protection Regulations and this policy apply to all of [CUSTOMER_NAME]’ Personal Data processing functions, including those performed on customers’, clients’, employees’, suppliers’ and partners’ Personal Data, and any other Personal Data that [CUSTOMER_NAME] Processes from any source.  [CUSTOMER_NAME] has implemented engineering and communications procedures/worksheets that require a review of Privacy by Design principles prior to implementation or development of processes that involve personal data.

This program applies to all [CUSTOMER_NAME] employees and outsourced personnel. Any breach of the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations will be dealt with under [CUSTOMER_NAME] disciplinary policy and may also be a criminal offence, in which case the matter will be reported as soon as possible to the appropriate authorities. Partners and any third parties working with or for [CUSTOMER_NAME], and who have or may have access to Personal Data, are expected to comply with all contractual and applicable regulatory obligations. No Third Party may access Personal Data held by [CUSTOMER_NAME] without having first agreed to confidentiality language set forth in the applicable agreement, which imposes on the third-party obligations no less onerous than those to which [CUSTOMER_NAME] is committed, and which gives [CUSTOMER_NAME] the right to audit compliance with the agreement.

[CUSTOMER_NAME] engages with consultants to assist with periodic audits of the program.  In addition, it utilizes consultants and industry resources to prepare for changes to Privacy and Data Protection Regulations.

8. Data transfers

8.1[CUSTOMER_NAME] treats all exports of data from within the Data Subject’s home country to other countries (or regions, i.e., with respect to EU GDPR) as unlawful unless there is an appropriate “level of protection for the fundamental rights of the Data Subjects.”  In all cases, [CUSTOMER_NAME] will enter into appropriate contractual terms regarding the transfer (Data Processing Agreement), covering a Processor’s obligations as well as any of its sub-processors.  Third parties are assessed at the beginning of the relationship, upon any changes to the relationship, and every one to three years during the relationship pursuant to [CUSTOMER_NAME]’ Vendor Management Policy and Procedures.  The following additional safeguards or exceptions may also apply depending on the origin and destination of the Personal Data:
8.1.1 An adequacy decision
Many countries maintain lists of other countries that adhere to adequate information and security protocols.  For example, countries that are members of the European Economic Area (EEA) but not of the EU are accepted as having met the conditions for an adequacy decision related to Personal Data derived from those countries’ residents.   
8.1.2 Binding corporate rules
Parties may adopt approved binding corporate rules for the transfer of data outside a Data Subject’s home country. In the EU, this requires submission to the relevant supervisory authority for approval of the rules that [CUSTOMER_NAME] is seeking to rely upon.  
8.1.3 Model contract clauses
[CUSTOMER_NAME] have adopted approved model contract clauses for the transfer of data outside of the EEA in connection with their Joint Controller arrangement.  These clauses may be provided in conjunction with a Data Processing Agreement and are updated as required by changes in law, regulation, or guidance.
8.1.4 Exceptions
In the absence of an adequacy decision, binding corporate rules, and/or model contract clauses, a transfer of Personal Data to a third country or international organization shall only take place on one of the following conditions:
●the Data Subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for the Data Subject due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards;
●the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the Data Subject and the Controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the Data Subject's request;
●the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the Data Subject between the Controller and another natural or legal person;
●the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest;
●the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and/or
●the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of other persons, where the Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.
In all cases, a Transfer Impact Assessment will be completed (see below).
9. Assessments
9.1 Data Protection Impact Assessments
●[CUSTOMER_NAME] conducts data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) in relation to the processing of Personal Data by [CUSTOMER_NAME] that potentially poses a high risk to the rights and freedoms to Data Subjects. [CUSTOMER_NAME] DPIA template follows EU requirements and guidelines.  [CUSTOMER_NAME] uses a template provided by its EU Data Protection Officer.  Where, as a result of a DPIA, [CUSTOMER_NAME] chooses to commence processing of Personal Data that could cause damage and/or distress to the Data Subjects, the decision as to whether [CUSTOMER_NAME] may proceed must be escalated for review to the Chief Operating Officer and the EU Data Protection Officer/UK Data Protection Representative.  The EU Data Protection Officer/UK Data Protection Representative shall, if there are significant concerns either as to the potential damage or distress or the quantity of data concerned, escalate the matter to the applicable supervisory authority.
●DPIA are updated at least every three (3) years and more often if there is a material change in the processing activity.
●Appropriate controls will be selected from Annex A of ISO 27001 or similar security standards and applied to reduce the level of risk associated with processing individual data to an acceptable level, by reference to the requirements of the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations.  Mitigating measures are communicated by Operations to the business owner of the processing activity, who is responsible for implementation of any necessary changes to the process.  The applicable DPIA is updated once the additional controls are in place.
●DPIAs are maintained by Operations in both the Shared Drive and saved to the appropriate Processing Activity record in [NAME_SYSTEM].

9.2 Privacy Impact Assessment 
[CUSTOMER_NAME] conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) as required by various Privacy and Data Protection Regulations related to the processing of personal data.  PIAs are conducted on all new processing activities that do not warrant a DPIA. Where a DPIA is conducted for a processing activity, a PIA will not be conducted.  PIAs are conducted and maintained by Operations within [NAME_SYSTEM] using the [NAME_SYSTEM] template and saved to the appropriate Processing Activity record in [NAME_SYSTEM].

9.3 Transfer Impact Assessments
[CUSTOMER_NAME] conducts Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) as set forth by the EU for transfers of data across borders (unless approved within certain regions, i.e., EEA).  TIAs are not completed for transfers of European Personal Data to jurisdictions that have obtained Adequacy status (however, appropriate contractual measures are still required).  [CUSTOMER_NAME] utilizes a TIA template provided by its EU Data Protection Officer, who reviews and provides advice in each instance.  Where possible, risks are mitigated contractually and by implementing supplementary measures according to the requirements of the Privacy and Data Protection Regulations and the Supervisory Authorities' guidelines.  Unmitigated risks are provided to the Chief Operating Officer for review and acceptance or denial and completed TIAs are maintained by Operations in both the Shared Drive and saved to the appropriate Asset record in [NAME_SYSTEM].

9.4 LIA
[CUSTOMER_NAME] conducts Legitimate Interest Assessments (LIAs) as required by various Privacy and Data Protection Regulations related to the processing of personal data that relies on the legitimate interest legal processing basis.  LIAs related to European Personal Data are reviewed by [CUSTOMER_NAME]’ EU Data Protection Officer. Unmitigated risks are provided to the Chief Operating Officer for review and acceptance or denial. LIAs are conducted and maintained by Operations within [NAME_SYSTEM] using the [NAME_SYSTEM] template and saved to the appropriate Processing Activity record in [NAME_SYSTEM].
10. Information asset register/data inventory
10.1[CUSTOMER_NAME] has established a data inventory and data flow process as part of its approach to address risks and opportunities throughout its privacy and data protection compliance program. [CUSTOMER_NAME]’ data inventory  determines:
●business processes that use Personal Data;
●source of Personal Data; 
●volume of Data Subjects;
●description of each item of Personal Data;
●processing activity;
●maintains the inventory of data categories of Personal Data it Processes; 
●documents the purpose(s) for which each category of Personal Data is used;
●recipients, and potential recipients, of the Personal Data;
●the role of [CUSTOMER_NAME] throughout the data flow;
●key systems and repositories;
●any data transfers; and
●all retention and disposal requirements. 
10.2[CUSTOMER_NAME] reviews and updates the data inventory on an ongoing basis to ensure it remains accurate related to any changes in the entities processing activities.
